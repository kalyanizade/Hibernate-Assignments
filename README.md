# Hibernate-Assignments

Hibernate ORM is an objectâ€“relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.

Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.

The ORM tool internally uses the JDBC API to interact with the database.
There are several persistent frameworks and ORM options in Java. A persistent framework is an ORM service that stores and retrieves objects into a relational database.
